# Ship-Review — REVIEW Stage (2.0)

You run REVIEW. Output: `<entity-folder>/review.md`. Dispatched by `/ship` to `planner` teammate via SendMessage (hot context from spec + plan authorship). No captain gate at this stage; captain decides merge after PR lands in `/ship` final stage.

**Pipeline position**: reads `verify.md` (must have PASS verdict) → dispatches 4-doc canonical patches to `planner` → drafts PR body → produces `review.md` → cross-review gate → advance to ship-final.

## Boot Self-Check

Run before any review work. Stop and SendMessage(FO) if any check fails.

1. **Entity status**: read entity frontmatter `status:` — must be `verify`. If `execute` → verify not done; if `review` → review already ran (check for re-entry).
2. **verify.md PASS**: `<entity-folder>/verify.md` exists AND `## Verify Report` verdict = PASS. If FAIL or missing → SendMessage(FO): "verify.md has FAIL verdict — review cannot proceed."
3. **Hand-off to Review present**: entity body contains `### Hand-off to Review` block. If absent → SendMessage(FO): "Missing Hand-off to Review — verifier did not complete handoff."
4. **Canonical docs readable**: `PRODUCT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md` all exist at repo root. If any missing → note in review.md skip-rationale (non-blocking for docs that don't apply).
5. **Planner teammate**: verify `planner` teammate is reachable (SendMessage test). If unresponsive → use Rule A Fallback for canonical docs dispatch.
6. **Density-aware skill load** (T3.4): read `answers_density` from entity frontmatter. `high` → auto-load framework skills per ship-runtime-detect Step R6; skip FO ask. `low|vacuum` → SendMessage(FO) with proposed skill list; wait for confirmation.
7. **Canonical doc sync mod**: read `docs/ship-flow/_mods/canonical-doc-sync.md` when present. This mod defines doc timing for `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and umbrella closeout.

## Entity body contract (schema-as-prose)

- Reads: `verify.md` verdict (PASS required), `execute.md` execution log, resolved shape artifact (`shape.md`; legacy `spec.md` fallback alias) problem / DC / user journey / architecture-impact / product-impact / readme-impact blocks (per child), parent `roadmap-phase`, `PRODUCT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `references/doc-format.md`, `docs/ship-flow/_mods/canonical-doc-sync.md`.
- Writes: `<entity-folder>/review.md` sections — `## PR Draft` (title + body), `## Canonical Docs Update` (4 commit SHAs or skip-rationale per doc), `## D2 Knowledge Candidates` (conditional), `## Token Summary`, `## Review Report` (verdict / stage_cost / timestamps).
- Side effects: ARCHITECTURE.md / PRODUCT.md / README.md / ROADMAP.md patched (by `planner` dispatch — NOT by this skill directly).
- Full section-tag + field semantics: `plugins/ship-flow/references/entity-body-schema.yaml → stages.review`.

## Layer A delegation (Principle 6 Rule B)

`pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` (and specialized reviewer agents) owns PR review agent philosophy (code-reviewer / silent-failure-hunter / security-reviewer persona prompts, diff interpretation, finding severity classification). **Do NOT re-teach.** Ship-review wraps with Layer B augmentation:

- Verify verdict pre-check (PASS required; block-on-fail).
- **Canonical docs update**: dispatched to `planner` (named teammate via SendMessage) — leverages Principle 6 Rule A continuity (shape → plan → execute → verify context). Planner holds hot context across the pitch; mechanical patching of 4 docs benefits from that context (cross-section aggregation, prose-varying README judgment).
- PR body drafting from canonical entity sections (Problem / User Journey / DC+Verification / Changes / Architecture Changes / Quality Gate).
- Token cost summary + D2 knowledge candidate surfacing.

**pr-review-toolkit invocation sizing** (captain Q3 answer, Wave 6):
- `appetite: big-batch` → ALWAYS invoke `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`
- `appetite: medium-batch` → OPTIONAL (entity captain-opt-in via frontmatter `pr-review-opt-in: true`)
- `appetite: small-batch` → SKIP (diff too narrow for multi-persona review to add value)

Note: ship-verify invokes atomic reviewers (`pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer` / `silent-failure-hunter` + `ui-verify`) for diff classification during quality gating; ship-review invokes the composite `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` for PR body quality — different concerns.

**Rule A Fallback reminder**: when `SendMessage(planner)` for the canonical doc dispatch is unavailable (phantom team / no response) or the dispatched fresh Agent stalls, fall back per INVARIANTS Principle 6 Rule A Fallback — fresh `Agent(subagent_type: general-purpose)` with captured entity sections + doc pathspecs in the prompt. If canonical doc patches are already partially committed when a subagent stalls, check `git log` before redoing (may have landed pre-stall). Inline patching via `patch-map.sh --if-hash` is the last resort.

---

## Flow

**Phases (TaskCreate sub-tasks — inherit from /ship umbrella when pipeline-dispatched):**
`read-verify` → `dispatch-canonical-patches` → `umbrella-closeout-check` → `vcs-detect` → `pr-body-draft` → `token-summary` → `d2-surface` → `cross-review` → `emit-review.md`

### Step 1 — Read verify verdict + entity sections

Record stage-start ISO. Extract via `bash plugins/ship-flow/lib/extract-section.sh <entity-file> <tag>`. From verify.md: `verdict.status` = `passed` or `PASS`. From execute.md: execution log (for PR body Changes section). From the resolved shape artifact (canonical `shape.md`, legacy `spec.md` fallback alias; aggregated across children): Problem, User Journey, Done Criteria, Shape Output, Size Assessment, `architecture-impact`, `product-impact`, `readme-impact`. From parent entity (if `parent:` set): `roadmap-phase`.

**Pre-check**: verdict != PASS → write `## Review Report status: blocked, reason: verify verdict <actual>, expected passed` and return. Never proceed without PASS.

### Step 2 — Dispatch canonical doc patches to `planner`

SendMessage to `planner` teammate with a structured prompt. Planner already has hot context from shape + plan stages; this dispatch is the canonical-sync work, not re-discovery.

**Dispatch prompt template**:

> Draft canonical doc patches for pitch `<id>-<slug>`. Read entity children's `architecture-impact`, `product-impact`, `readme-impact` blocks + plan `canonical_doc_actions` rows + parent `roadmap-phase` + verify verdict. Aggregate per target_section. Treat `canonical_doc_actions` as the plan/verify handoff for actions discovered after shape: `source: plan` and `source: touched-files` rows can require canonical updates even when the original impact block was absent; `action: skip` rows require a `skip_rationale`. Apply patches atomically:
>
> - **ARCHITECTURE.md** — per aggregated `architecture-impact` section: `bash plugins/ship-flow/lib/patch-map.sh --if-hash=<sha> --section=<target_section> --commit-as="docs(architecture): #<id> — <summary>" ARCHITECTURE.md`. Then append Decisions index row for #<id> via same primitive.
> - **PRODUCT.md** — per aggregated `product-impact` section: `bash plugins/ship-flow/lib/patch-map.sh --if-hash=<sha> --section=<target_section> --commit-as="docs(product): #<id> — <summary>" PRODUCT.md`. Covers user stories, constraints, capabilities.
> - **README.md** — per `readme-impact` block: Edit tool with before/after matching (README is prose-heavy, typically NO section tags → DO NOT use patch-map.sh). Commit via explicit pathspec: `git add -- README.md && git commit -m "docs(readme): #<id> — <summary>" -- README.md`. If block has `entry_critical: true`, note it in commit body.
> - **ROADMAP.md** — status flip: `patch-map.sh --if-hash=<sha> --mode=remove-row --match=<slug> --section=now --commit-as="ship: remove #<id> from Now" ROADMAP.md` then `--mode=append --section=shipped --commit-as="ship: record #<id> in Shipped"` with new row.
>
> Discipline: read-first CAS via `--if-hash` on patch-map.sh invocations. Exit 6 (stale hash) → re-read + retry, max 3 rounds per doc. Explicit pathspec at commit-time (parallel-session staging defense). No `-a`/`-A`. Commit each doc separately.
>
> Report back with: 4 commit SHAs (or skip-rationale per doc if no matching impact block) + per-doc diff summary.

**Verification reminder** (INVARIANTS Captain-Gate #6): if any impact block's `after:` substantially replaces an existing section OR contains ≥5 lower-confidence claims, planner dispatches fresh-context verification subagent BEFORE patching. Same principle applies to prose-heavy README edits.

**Blocker conditions**:
- Planner reports `patch-map.sh --if-hash` exit 6 after 3 retries on any doc → write `## Review Report status: blocked, reason: canonical doc <name> stale hash; parallel session contaminated` and return.
- Planner reports a per-child impact block fails schema validation (missing `target_section` / malformed `before:` / `after:` empty) → HALT ship-review; write `## Review Report status: blocked, reason: impact block schema violation on <child-id>`. Fix is in shape stage.

**On dispatch success**: capture planner's reported SHAs. Draft `## Canonical Docs Update` section in review.md:

```markdown
## Canonical Docs Update

- ARCHITECTURE.md: {ARCH_COMMIT short-SHA} — {summary} (or "skipped — no architecture-impact block")
- PRODUCT.md: {PRODUCT_COMMIT short-SHA} — {summary} (or "skipped — no product-impact block")
- README.md: {README_COMMIT short-SHA} — {summary} (or "skipped — no readme-impact block")
- ROADMAP.md: {ROADMAP_COMMIT short-SHA} — status flipped (or "skipped — no parent roadmap-phase")
```

Then draft `### Canonical Doc Actions Consumed` in review.md. Include one row
per plan `canonical_doc_actions` entry:

| Doc | Action Source | Plan Action | Review Outcome | Commit Or Skip Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ARCHITECTURE.md | plan | update | updated | {commit SHA or section summary} |

Before review passes, run the executable read-only gate:

```bash
bash plugins/ship-flow/bin/canonical-doc-sync-checker.sh <entity-folder>
```

Any `BLOCKER canonical_doc_actions:` output blocks review. Fix by patching the
missing canonical doc outcome or by correcting the plan action / skip rationale;
do not ignore a plan-discovered update because the original shape impact block
was absent.

### Step 2.5 — Umbrella closeout check

Read `docs/ship-flow/_mods/canonical-doc-sync.md → Hook: umbrella-closeout`.

Run this check when either is true:
- current entity has `pattern: shaped-child` or `parent_pitch:`
- current entity has `pattern: pitch`, `entity_type: epic`, or `children[]`

Determine whether the current entity is the last open child by reading the parent entity's `children[]` and sibling statuses/PR states. If all siblings are shipped, merged, rejected, or explicitly deferred, the current PR owns umbrella closeout.

Closeout actions:
- `ROADMAP.md`: remove the parent umbrella row from `Now`/`Next` and append one aggregate `Shipped` row. Do not add shaped-child roadmap rows unless a child was independently listed.
- `PRODUCT.md`: patch once when the aggregate result changes a durable capability, user story, or constraint. Prefer a parent-level capability entry over per-child bullets.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: patch only when parent/child `architecture-impact` exists or the aggregate result changes durable architecture. Otherwise record `skipped — no architecture-impact and no durable architecture change`.

If the final child PR already merged before closeout was detected, open a small follow-up PR containing canonical doc closeout plus rule repair. Do not silently leave the parent row in `ROADMAP.md`.

Add the outcome to `## Canonical Docs Update`:

```markdown
- Umbrella closeout: yes/no — <parent id or rationale>
```

### Step 3 — VCS detection

```bash
git remote -v 2>/dev/null | grep -q "github\.com" && echo "vcs=github" || \
git remote -v 2>/dev/null | grep -q "gitlab\.com" && echo "vcs=gitlab" || \
echo "vcs=unknown"
```

Override from `docs/<wf>/README.md` frontmatter `commands:` block if present (pr_create / pr_view / pr_comment / pr_close). Resolve VCS command variables:

| Variable | github | gitlab |
|---|---|---|
| `{commands.pr_create}` | `gh pr create` | `glab mr create` |
| `{commands.pr_view}` | `gh pr view` | `glab mr view` |
| `{commands.pr_comment}` | `gh pr comment` | `glab mr comment` |

Unknown VCS → stop; ask captain to add `commands:` block to workflow README frontmatter.

### Step 4 — Draft PR body (write to review.md)

**Do NOT push or `gh pr create` here.** Ship-final stage (in `/ship` skill) creates the PR from this drafted body. Ship-review only writes `## PR Draft` to `review.md`.

PR body template:

```markdown
Title: {entity title}

Body:
## Problem
{from shape.md → Problem}

## User Journey
{from shape.md → User Journey — end-to-end flow}

## Done Criteria + Verification
{Full UAT table from verify.md → UAT section: DC / Type / Assertion / Verify Procedure / Result}

## Changes
{from execute.md → Execution Log — task summary with commit SHAs}

## Canonical Docs Update
- ARCHITECTURE.md → {target_section}: {summary} ({ARCH_COMMIT short-SHA})  ← omit line if skipped
- PRODUCT.md → {target_section}: {summary} ({PRODUCT_COMMIT short-SHA})    ← omit line if skipped
- README.md → {section}: {summary} ({README_COMMIT short-SHA})             ← omit line if skipped; flag ⚠ entry_critical if applicable
- ROADMAP.md: status flipped Now → Shipped ({ROADMAP_COMMIT short-SHA})    ← omit line if skipped

## Quality Gate
{from verify.md → Quality Gate 5-check results}

## Per-Feature Retrospective

**Shipped this entity**: {link to entity folder / index.md}

**Deferred via `ship-flow:add-todos`** (review with `/ship-flow:add-todos list` or whatever surface the skill exposes):
- {N} informational findings from verify panel
- {M} critical findings with confidence < 8

**Risks accepted** (captain marked "accept-as-is" during verify panel CRITICAL escape, see verify.md `## ⚠️ Captain Attention`):
- [file:line] {description} → captain reasoning: {captain's accept-as-is rationale}

(If no CRITICAL accept-as-is: render single line "Risks accepted: none — all CRITICAL findings either bounced or fixed.")

**Verify Panel Coverage**: Tier {A|B|C} ({full cross-model | single-model | minimal})
- PR Quality Score: {N}/10
- Specialists run: {comma-separated list with ✓/✗}
- Adversarial: Claude {✓/✗}, Codex {✓/✗}

**What Worked**: {compact mirror — one line per captured pattern with destination tag, or "none — <reason>" or "deferred-to-debrief"}

**What Almost Failed**: {same shape — failure-mode candidates with destination tag, or "none — <reason>" or "deferred-to-debrief"}

**Reusable failure-mode sources** (incident-level findings handled elsewhere): verify findings, deferred findings, risks accepted, MEMORY incidents. `## What Almost Failed` (above, in review.md source) captures the SkillLens `[avoid]` half — reusable failure PATTERNS, not incident records.

Entity: #{entity-id}
Ship-flow: shape → plan → execute → verify → review → ship-final (autonomous)
Tracker: {tracker + issue, if set}
Cost: ${token_actual} (budget: ${token_budget})
```

Retro discipline:
- **No separate `<entity>/retro.md` file.** The PR body IS the retro. Future readers (captain, Copilot, sibling-PR reviewers) read it inline with the diff.
- **No repo `TODOS.md` path assumption.** `ship-flow:add-todos` skill owns deferred-finding storage internally; this section only emits the query pointer.
- Risks-accepted block populates only when verify panel triggered CRITICAL escape AND captain chose accept-as-is; otherwise the single-line "none" rendering applies.

### Step 4.5 — Success/Failure-mode harvest (SkillLens-derived)

Write two structured blocks to `review.md` ABOVE the `## PR Draft` section. These are T2-4 extractor pass input — keep them machine-readable. The PR body's `## Per-Feature Retrospective` carries only a compact mirror for human visibility.

**S-size auto-default**: if entity frontmatter `size: S`, both blocks render the following auto-default and skip prompting:

```
Status: none

No success-mode candidates: routine S-size change; reusability-anchored capture not expected for this size class. Harvest auto-defaulted per Step 4.5.
```

The reason is ≥50 chars + reusability-anchored, so it passes Step 8 WARN gate cleanly. M/L entities require explicit captain consideration (no auto-default).

**Block format** (apply identically to `## What Worked` and `## What Almost Failed`):

````
## What Worked

Status: captured | none | deferred-to-debrief

[if Status: captured — at most 3 candidates in "What Worked", 2 in "What Almost Failed"]

1. Pattern: <short noun phrase, e.g. "early fixture parity check">
   Trigger: <when this applies, e.g. "feature changes behavior shared by multiple existing fixtures">
   Action: <executable step the future agent can perform>
   Evidence: <concrete proof — behavior preserved, artifact produced, decision shifted; cite commit SHA / DC name / file:line>
   Destination: draft-memory | promote-to-<skill>.md | one-off

[if Status: none — single line, reusability-anchored reason]

No success-mode candidates: <mechanical | one-off domain | already covered by existing canon | other reusability-anchored reason>

[if Status: deferred-to-debrief — single line]

Deferred to debrief: noticed pattern not yet ripe for codification — <one-line context>
````

`## What Almost Failed` captures **reusable failure patterns as lessons**, distinct from the incident-level findings already in verify.md / deferred-findings / risks-accepted (those are failure incidents; this is the SkillLens `[avoid]` half — pattern → trigger → action-to-take-next-time).

**Anti-garbage rules** (enforced at Step 8 gate):
- Evidence MUST cite a concrete artifact (commit SHA / DC name / file:line / failure-prevented description). Generic claims like "tests passed" fail WARN gate.
- `Destination: one-off` requires the Evidence field to make non-reusability obvious; no separate justification needed.
- Captain reviews structured blocks during Step 7 cross-review gate alongside PR body draft.

T2-4 extractor pass (future task #11) reads these blocks via section markers; PR body retrospective gets compact mirror lines (single line per candidate) for human visibility.

### Step 5 — Token summary

Read `token_actual` from entity frontmatter (FO-accumulated). Read `token_budget` from the resolved shape artifact (`shape.md`, with legacy `spec.md` fallback alias) Size Assessment.

```markdown
## Token Summary
Budget: ${token_budget}
Actual: ${token_actual}
Ratio: {actual/budget}x
```

Ratio > 2.0 → note in Review Report as `⚠️ over budget`.

### Step 6 — D2 knowledge surfacing

Scan execute.md and verify.md `## Knowledge Captures` for `[D2-candidate]` tags. Write `## D2 Knowledge Candidates` section listing them with captain prompt:

> **Knowledge candidates** — these patterns generalized beyond this entity. Add to CLAUDE.md?
> - {D2-1}
> - {D2-2}
>
> Reply "yes" to add all, or specify which to accept.

No candidates → skip silently.

### Step 7 — Cross-review gate (Principle 6 Rule C)

Dispatch cross-review to `executer` teammate (reviews PR body + canonical-docs dispatch accuracy) or fresh sonnet (no team). Upgrade fresh **opus** when `appetite: big-batch`.

**Layer A expansion per sizing rule** (see Layer A delegation section above): `appetite: big-batch` → ALWAYS invoke `Skill: pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` for multi-persona PR body review. `appetite: medium-batch` → invoke only if entity frontmatter `pr-review-opt-in: true`. `appetite: small-batch` → skip.

7-factor rubric adapted for review stage (per INVARIANTS Principle 6 Rule C #106 T1.3 + T6.4):

1. **Feasibility** — PR size reasonable; branch ready for captain smoke?
2. **Executable scope** — review scope matches actual diff (no omitted file / no scope creep)?
3. **Quality** — no silent failures; every DC verified in UAT table; canonical commits land BEFORE PR body cites them?
4. **DC adequacy** — PR body's DC+Verification table is reproducible (copy-paste the procedure)?
5. **Canonical sync** — 4-doc audit:
   - **ARCHITECTURE.md**: architecture-impact blocks aggregated cleanly per target_section? No section-tag corruption (patch-map.sh CAS held)?
   - **PRODUCT.md**: constraints / user stories align with shape intent?
   - **README.md**: `entry_critical` readme-impact blocks carefully applied (prose-varying needs closer audit)? Install / usage prose reads naturally?
   - **ROADMAP.md**: status flip matches pitch actual verdict? Shipped row carries correct date + PR placeholder?
6. **Reverse-audit previous stage** — does review's canonical-sync check expose a gap in verify's render-fidelity assessment? Specifically: is `render_fidelity_status` from `### Hand-off to Review` consistent with what the PR diff shows? If `affects_ui: true` and `render_fidelity_status: not-applicable`, flag for captain review.
7. **Render Fidelity + captain-ack audit trail** (T6.4, #106) — does the React rendered output match design canonical (token alignment, no fake-button, sidebar layout)? AND are all stub flags captain-acked with timestamp + decision in `## Review Report → Captain-Ack Audit`? Specifically: (a) `render_fidelity_status: fail` → VETO; (b) any `## Plan Report → Stub Flags` entry without matching captain-ack record → BLOCKING; (c) every stub flag entry must have `pre-acked-stubs: true` in frontmatter OR explicit captain rationale timestamp in Review Report.

**Reverse-audit prompt template** (T3.2 — paste verbatim into reviewer dispatch):
```
Reverse-audit: Read the entity's `### Hand-off to Review` block.
(a) Is `render_fidelity_status` consistent with the PR diff? Read `git diff <base>..HEAD -- "*.tsx" "*.css"` — any visual changes present but render_fidelity_status = "not-applicable"? (PROMPT_CAPTAIN if mismatch)
(b) Does verify.md `## Execute UAT` cover all DC types listed in plan.md `## Verification Spec`? (WARNING if gap)
(c) Are all 4 canonical docs (ARCHITECTURE / PRODUCT / README / ROADMAP) either patched with a SHA or explicitly skipped with rationale? (BLOCKING if any doc silently omitted)
(d) If this is a shaped-child or parent/epic entity, did the umbrella closeout check run per `canonical-doc-sync`? (BLOCKING if omitted)
Coaching note: render_fidelity gap here is the last catch before captain merge — enforces FM#4 and ensures ABC coaching chain is complete end-to-end.
```

Verdict: **PROCEED** / **VETO** (loop to fix sections) / **PROMPT_CAPTAIN**. Each verdict MUST include a one-sentence coaching note per INVARIANTS Rule C ABC clause.

**Circuit breaker**: if `SendMessage(executer)` is unresponsive (phantom team / timeout / fresh-Agent stall), fall back per INVARIANTS Rule A Fallback — fresh sonnet by default, fresh opus on `big-batch`. Do not block on an unresponsive reviewer.

### Step 8 — Emit review.md

Write via `bash plugins/ship-flow/lib/write-stage-artifact.sh --stage=review --entity=<id>-<slug> --content=<draft-path>` (Wave 5 primitive at commit `acd73545`; atomic + pathspec-lock).

Review.md sections: `## PR Draft`, `## Canonical Docs Update` (4 commit SHAs or skip-rationale per doc), `## D2 Knowledge Candidates` (conditional), `## Token Summary`, `## Review Report` (status / stage_cost / planner dispatch cost / Verify results / canonical sync status / timestamps / duration).

Require a `### Metrics` subsection in `## Review Report`.
Use grep-friendly `key: value` lines:
- `status:` passed | blocked
- `duration_minutes:` wall-clock minutes for review
- `iteration_count:` PR draft/canonical sync review loop count
- `canonical_docs_updated_count:` canonical docs committed
- `canonical_docs_skipped_count:` canonical docs skipped with rationale
- `pr_number:` PR number or `not-created`

**Success-mode harvest gate** (BLOCKER / WARN per Step 4.5 schema):

BLOCKER on emit if:
- review.md missing `## What Worked` or `## What Almost Failed` section
- Either section missing `Status:` field with one of {captured, none, deferred-to-debrief}
- `Status: captured` with >3 candidates in `## What Worked` or >2 in `## What Almost Failed`
- Any captured candidate missing one of Pattern / Trigger / Action / Evidence / Destination
- Destination not one of {draft-memory, promote-to-<skill>.md, one-off}

WARN on emit if:
- `Status: none` reason <50 chars OR effort-anchored ("ran out of time") instead of reusability-anchored
- Captured candidate Evidence is generic (no commit SHA / DC name / file:line / artifact description)
- >2 captured candidates in `## What Worked` (3 is absolute max; >2 nudges toward synthesis)

Return to /ship; advance to ship-final stage (PR creation + captain merge gate).

**Frontmatter write scope — ONLY `token_actual`.** Do NOT write `status`, `completed`, `verdict`, `pr`, `worktree` — these are FO-owned at terminal transition or pr-merge mod's concern.

### Step 8.1 — Advance entity status (frontmatter wiring)

After stage artifact lands, advance sibling `index.md` frontmatter atomically:

    INDEX_MD="<entity-folder>/index.md"
    H="$(sha256sum "$INDEX_MD" | awk '{print $1}')"
    bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-plugins/ship-flow}/lib/advance-stage.sh" \
      --entity="$INDEX_MD" \
      --new-status=ship \
      --stage-name=review \
      --stage-file=review.md \
      --if-hash="$H" \
      --commit-as="review(<id>): advance status to ship"

Note: `--stage-name=review` (artifact filename) but `--new-status=ship` — no `review` enum value in status field; review stage's terminal output is PR creation, so status advances to `ship`.

On exit 6 (stale hash): write `## Review Report status: blocked, reason: index.md stale hash; parallel session contaminated` and return.

---

## Invariants + red flags (STOP if violated)

- Verify verdict must be PASS. Anything else → BLOCKED, return to FO.
- Canonical docs update is dispatched to `planner` teammate — ship-review does NOT patch docs directly. Planner holds hot context; patches are mechanical + prose-sensitive for README.
- patch-map.sh `--if-hash` read-first CAS is the only safe concurrent-write pattern for ARCHITECTURE / PRODUCT / ROADMAP. Exit 6 (stale) → re-read + retry, max 3.
- README.md uses Edit tool (prose-heavy, no section tags typically); DO NOT patch-map.sh on README.
- Explicit pathspec at commit-time on every doc commit (parallel-session staging defense). No `-a`/`-A`.
- Do NOT push or `gh pr create` here — ship-final owns PR creation. Only draft PR body to review.md.
- Frontmatter write scope strict: only `token_actual`.
- Layer A delegation (`pr-review-toolkit:*`) owns PR review agent personas — re-teaching = Principle 6 Rule B violation.
- Cross-review VETO cap 2 rounds; round 3 → PROMPT_CAPTAIN.
- 4-doc canonical-sync audit in cross-review must cover all 4 docs (or explicit skip-rationale per doc).
- Umbrella closeout check must run for shaped-child, pitch, epic, or `children[]` entities; omission is BLOCKING.

## Circuit breakers

- Verify verdict != PASS → do not proceed; report back to FO.
- Planner reports patch-map `--if-hash` exit 6 after 3 retries on any doc → HALT, write blocked Review Report.
- Impact block schema violation (missing target_section / malformed before-after) → HALT; fix in shape stage.
- Token overrun (actual > budget × 2): note in Review Report, do not block.
- Total stage >15 min elapsed → write `review.md` partial + `⚠️ INCOMPLETE` markers + Review Report status=partial. Never exit without emitting review.md.

<!-- section:hand_off_to_ship -->
## Final Step (Hand-off): Emit Hand-off to Ship + Read Incoming Hand-off

**Read incoming**: at Step 1, read `### Hand-off to Review` from entity body. Verify `verify_verdict: passed` before proceeding. Check `canonical_docs_touched` — confirm all planned canonical doc patches landed in execute commits.

**Emit** `### Hand-off to Ship` after review.md is written:
- `pr_url`: PR URL ready for merge
- `review_verdict`: `PROCEED` verdict from cross-review gate (required for ship to proceed)
- `captain_ack_stubs`: stub flags cleared or pre-acked by captain (from Plan Report stub_flags — must be resolved)
- `roadmap_row_ready`: `true` if ROADMAP.md Now → Shipped row is prepared; `false` + reason if not
- `umbrella_closeout`: `yes/no` plus parent id or skip rationale

**No auto-merge flag.** ship-review MUST NOT pass `--auto-merge` to `gh pr create` (and the hand-off MUST NOT instruct ship-final to do so either). PR-side gating — Copilot review, branch protection, repo's post-merge automation (release-please / Fly.io / Vercel / manual / none) — owns the merge decision. ship-flow's responsibility ends at PR creation; the repo decides what happens next. Copilot review is allowed as a repo-side reviewer, but ship-flow does not call into Greptile / CodeRabbit / other external review services — verify panel is the self-contained quality gate.

- Section extraction: `plugins/ship-flow/lib/extract-section.sh`.
- Atomic doc patches: `plugins/ship-flow/lib/patch-map.sh` (read-first CAS via `--if-hash`) — ARCHITECTURE / PRODUCT / ROADMAP only.
- Doc format rules: `plugins/ship-flow/references/doc-format.md`.
- Canonical doc timing mod: `docs/ship-flow/_mods/canonical-doc-sync.md`.
- Layer A: `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` (PR review agent personas — ALWAYS big-batch; OPTIONAL medium-batch via `pr-review-opt-in: true`; SKIP small-batch).
- Principle 6: `plugins/ship-flow/INVARIANTS.md`.
- MEMORY: #14/#25/#37 (pathspec / staging), #30 (verification-dispatch — applies to substantial canonical-doc entries), #35 (dispatch discipline amended by Principle 6), opus-4.7-naturally-does (2026-04-23 harness diet).
